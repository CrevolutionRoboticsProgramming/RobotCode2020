## Contributing

Aim to have your code be:

1. Effective
2. Readable
3. Intuitive
4. Minimal

If it works, that's what matters. That's what the simulator's for. Everything else should come after (or, preferably, during)

Only use patterns (mVariableName, dependency injection, singletons) where it helps. Everything will be homogenized eventually.
